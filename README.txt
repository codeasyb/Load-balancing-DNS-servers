Ls waits for the query from the client then sends it to TS1 to check if it holds 
The DNS and if it dont then send back the NOT FOUND and LS and will do a check that if 
TS1 doesn't have the DNS then by checking the length of the query it will move on to asking TS2 and will do the same until LS checks for all queries that are coming from the client and last thing if both TS1 and TS2 doesn't find anything then send back just a period to the client. 

Yes I had many issues and so many god damn dumb things I pulled my hair on it and pissed off, no sleep. Im done with Python 

Im just done...

I developed python skills forget the problems

I learned how Socketing is annoying and how Python pisses you off so much that you just love it more and more but overall I learned how local host talks over the server to clients and requests and how it looks for DNS

This was totally fun and insanely frustrating because I probably have deleted and wrote code and deleted code and rewrote code probably like million times.
